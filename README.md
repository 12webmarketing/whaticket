# WhaTicket

A _very simple_ Ticket System based on WhatsApp messages.

Backend uses [whatsapp-web.js](https://github.com/pedroslopez/whatsapp-web.js) to receive and send WhatsApp messages, create tickets from them and store all in a MySQL database.

The frontend is a full-featured _chat app_ bootstrapped with react-create-app and Material UI, that comunicates with backend using REST API and Websockets.

# Motivation

I'm a SysAdmin, and in my daily work, I do a lot of support through WhatsApp. Since WhatsApp Web don't allow multiple users, and 90% of our tickets cames from this channel, we created this to avoid the: 'Can I use Whatsapp now?' tap shoulder.
